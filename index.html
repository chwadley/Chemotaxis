		    Each boid (a colored circle) follows a biased random walk.<br/>Although each boid has some random acceleration each frame, the majority of its path is controlled by three rules - <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;separation (don't get too close to other boids), <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;alignment (match velocity to neighbor boids), and <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;centering (move closer to the center of the boid's group).<br/>Boids are also attracted to the cursor. <br/>Credit to <a href="https://eater.net/boids">Ben Eater</a> for some of the equations for this simulation.
